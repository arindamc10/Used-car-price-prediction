In this project,I have used Machine Learning algorithm to predict the prices of used cars.The use of this model will help both sellers and buyers to get the optimum price for the car that is to be sold or bought.Various features such as mileage,company,power,no of seats,transmission,owner_type,location,etc has been taken into account.
